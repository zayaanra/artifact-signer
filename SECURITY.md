# Artifact Signer Security Policy

## Overview
This security policy outlines what you should do should any security related issues/bugs arise.

It would also be beneficial to review how Sigstore and Cosign work to understand the overall security of this project: https://docs.sigstore.dev/

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you believe that there is a vulnerability in the code, please raise an issue with the label `vulnerability`. If that label does not fit, please seek another appropiate label.

The raised issue should have intensive documentation regarding the vulnerability. It should also reference the code in question. Please provide context on why you think the code is vulnerable and if it is vulnerable, include the steps you took to reach that conclusion. This way, we can reconstruct the problem.

### Correcting the vulnerability
If a vulnerability is proven to be real, the owner of the repository will go ahead and correct the problem. The issue will be closed upon completion. The repository will be updated with the new code. Any changes to the repository will be kept in a changelog.
